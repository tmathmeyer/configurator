                                    PREAMBLE
      If this program accidentally screws up and destroys data on your PC,
 electrocutes you, makes your monitor explode in your face, set's your house on
  fire, kills you, changes all the text you say in online games to oink, causes
   everyone on the planet (and beyond) to try to kill you, hacks into a nearby
  nuclear missile and targets your house, changes your bank balance to $0, gets
 you banned from online games, adds your name to a hitman's list, sucks you into
  the computer and plays pong with you (as the ball), causes secret agencies to
   come after you, makes you believe you got maggots crawling under your skin,
    turns your room into a gate to hell, becomes sentient and starts killing
  everyone on this planet, gets you sent to jail with a guy named big bubba or
   does anything else you don't want it to do, don't blame the author of this
                                    program.



                                  DISCLAIMER
               I don't claim this software is good for anything.
        If you think it is, cool. If it doesn't work, that's too bad.
               If you don't like this disclaimer, that's too bad.
        I reserve the right to do the absolute minimum provided by law,
                    up to and including absolutely nothing.
